# React Pizzeria

## Overview

**React Pizzeria** is a simple React application that displays a menu of pizzas, including their ingredients and prices. The application features a dynamic interface that indicates whether the pizzeria is currently open or closed based on the time of day.

## Features

- **Dynamic Menu Display**: Shows a list of pizzas with their ingredients, prices, and availability.
- **Sold Out Indicator**: Highlights pizzas that are sold out.
- **Operating Hours**: Displays whether the pizzeria is open or closed based on the current time.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Language used for implementing the application logic.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the components.

## Components

- **App**: The main component that renders `Header`, `Menu`, and `Footer`.
- **Header**: Displays the title of the application.
- **Menu**: Displays a list of pizzas and their details.
- **Pizza**: Represents individual pizza items.
- **Footer**: Displays the pizzeria's open/closed status based on the current time.

## How It Works

1. **Header**: Shows the title of the pizzeria.
2. **Menu**: Lists available pizzas, showing their photo, ingredients, and price. If a pizza is sold out, it displays "Sold Out".
3. **Footer**: Displays a message based on the current time, indicating whether the pizzeria is open or closed.
